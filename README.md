# OneWorldExchange

This is my iOS project for 67-442 Mobile Application Development in iOS. This app is a mobile payment service for group travelers abroad. Users can create travel groups, add members to these travel groups, and create new transactions for other members to pay off or pay off what has been charged to them in various currencies. What is unique about this app is that it takes into account the current exchange rate and automatically converts the amount for whatever two currencies are being exchanged. 

Note: this app is definitely still a work in progress. There are various functionalities that need to be refined/adjusted and some small interaction/aesthetic changes that need to be made in the future as well. In addition, as of right now, only the profile, groups, and log out on the navigation bar are working. I will continue to work on this app next semester as an independent study project.
