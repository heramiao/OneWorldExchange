# OneWorldExchange

This is my iOS project for 67-442 Mobile Application Development in iOS. This app is a mobile payment service for group travelers abroad. Users can create travel groups, add members to these travel groups, and create new transactions for other members to pay off or pay off what has been charged to them in various currencies. What is unique about this app is that it takes into account the current exchange rate and automatically converts the amount for whatever two currencies are being exchanged. 

Note: this app is very much still a work in progress. This is simply a prototype and there are various functionalities that need to be refined/adjusted and some interaction/aesthetic changes that need to be made in the future as well. For right now, when opening the app, the login page has no username/password constraints. It was inserted for presentation purposes but any input works and the app will run based on one user session only. In addition, only the profile, groups, and log out on the navigation bar are working. I will continue to work on this app next semester as an independent study project. 

List of current functionalities:
1. View user profile 
2. Edit user profile
3. See a list of all the travel groups you're in
4. Add a new travel group with new members
5. View a specific travel group's page
6. Edit a travel group and its members
7. Create a new transaction split amongst the group's members
8. Pay off transactions that are charged to you
